Developed a machine learning model for signature verification, evaluating its performance, and ensuring it works effectively across various signature samples. 
In terms of data collection and preprocessing, the process of gathering a significant number of signature images from participants. These images undergo various preprocessing steps, including standardization of file formats, resizing, cropping, and conversion to grayscale, to make them suitable for machine learning analysis.
 
The development of the model involves exploring and testing various machine learning techniques. These include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Each of these models is evaluated for its effectiveness in signature verification.
 
The evaluation of these models reveals that the CNN model achieves the highest accuracy at 94%, demonstrating excellent precision and recall. Other models like the Random Forest and SVM also show strong performance, while Logistic Regression and KNN offer balanced results. The Decision Tree model, however, is found to be less effective, indicating a need for further improvement.
